Early in the summer, the cat took a walk along a different road, just for a change of scenery. This road went through a short area with houses, and then into a small forest. 
The houses in this direction had small gardens, and only one of them had a cat.
This cat advocated walking in the forest, and now the first cat decided to try it. 
The road into the forest was boring at first, but quite beautiful. At least the cat thought humans might consider it beautiful. The cat would have preferred more interesting things than trees and plants, and flowers.
Then the cat noticed something it had not seen before; a huge ant hill!
Now this was something new!
