The red house was located at the top of a hill. 
When it rained, the water flowed from the slippery, pointed roof down into streams that continued down the hill.
The boy that lived in the house liked to make small paper ships and place in the streams and watch them float fast down the hill. 
At the bottom of the hill was another house, where lived a boy and girl. They would both use nets to catch the paper ships.
