The red house beside the purple factory was owned by a very tall woman with bright red hair. 
Her neighbor was a man who was almost a head smaller and he had hair that was always meticulately coloured in a strong neon green colour. 
Every day they would meet at the fence and play a game of chess on the chess board they had installed on the fence.
