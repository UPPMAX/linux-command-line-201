This is another story of the cat that walked along the street. 
It was a very long street, and it took a couple hours for the cat to walk the whole street every day, also because those animals it wanted to greet always talked for a long time.
The cat did not mind this, in fact this was the best entertainment in the cat's mind. 
Then one day a new family moved into the house at the end of the street. The pale green house which had been empty for as long as the cat could remember. 
The cat waited with interest to learn if any animals would also be moving in. 
After a week, the cat saw that there were indeed animals. The garden now had three cats and a dog!
