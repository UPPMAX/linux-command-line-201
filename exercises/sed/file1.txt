This is a story about a cat that walked down the street. 
Every day the cat walked the same street, passing several houses and gardens. 
In some gardens there were other cats and in some there were dogs. 
There were even some gardens that had rabbits, snakes, chickens, or lizards.
The cat looked with interest at all of these animals, but only greeted a few of them.
