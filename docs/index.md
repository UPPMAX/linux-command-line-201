# Intermediate Bash/Linux

Course on intermediate Bash/Linux, with an estimated duration of
[6 hours](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_intermediate_bash_linux/issues/2),
given in two half-days.

This course is given under <a href="https://www.naiss.se/" target="_blank">NAISS</a>, by staff working at the branches located at <a href="https://www.uu.se/centrum/uppmax/" target="_blank">UPPMAX</a> and <a href="https://www.hpc2n.umu.se" target="_blank">HPC2N</a>.

In this 6-hour, 2-day ONLINE workshop you will learn how to work smarter from a command line. You can follow either day or both.

Doing so, you will learn more Bash commands, scripting and some quality of life topics.

NOTE: You can run on your own (Linux) computer or on your favorite HPC cluster (that you already have access to).

At the end of each day, you should feel able to work smarter and able to avoid more grunt work (i.e. anything that involves repeated copypaste).

Intended participants: The workshop is intended for users with some Linux experience, see the prerequisites.

Eligibility: the NAISS course is open to current and future users in Swedish academia. Participation is free.

Remote/online participation: The course will be completely online and we will use Zoom. The participants will use their own computer or a computer system they have access to.
