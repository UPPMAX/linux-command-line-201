- Title: Evaluation survey and recordings
  from the course "Command Line 201", `[dates]`

Hello!

Thank you for participating in the NAISS course "Command Line 201"!

We have an evaluation survey for the course, which we would very much
like you to fill in, if you have not already. It will be very helpful
for us in planning and designing future courses, as well as adjusting
this course before giving it again. We will post the results of the
evaluation some time after the survey closes. The link will be found on
the GitHib page for the course.

Note, that if you watch the recordings afterwards during the rest of the
week, you are also very welcome to answer the evaluation since it tells
us something about how well (or not) we communicated the various subjects.

Link to the evaluation survey: `[survey_url]`

The evaluation survey is open until `[survey_closing_date_and_time]`.

The recordings from the course have been processed and uploaded to
HPC2N's YouTube channel, on a separate playlist here:

The presentations for the course will remain available for the
foreseeable future at: <https://uppmax.github.io/linux-command-line-201/>

The GitHub page for the course, with the rest of the material, including
the tarball with the exercises, will also remain for the foreseeable
future at: <https://github.com/UPPMAX/linux-command-line-201>

Best wishes,
