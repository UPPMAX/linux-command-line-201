# Prerequisites

We [decided](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_intermediate_bash_linux/issues/1)
to use
[The Command Line 101 course content](https://hpc2n.github.io/linux-command-line-101/)
as course prerequisite.

We assume you know that:

- Tab autocompletes commands
- `man` shows a manual
- `cat` shows text
- `less` and `more` show scrollable text
- `nano` is a text editor
- the command `find` is used for file and directory search.
- `sort` is a command that is used in Linux to print the output of a file in given order.
- `head` is used to print the first lines of a file
- `tail` prints the lines at the end of a file
