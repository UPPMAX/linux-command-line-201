My learning outcomes are:

- Learners can write scripts that require user input
- Learners can use bash variables
- Learners can use bash `if` statements
- Learners can use bash `if` statements with the 'or' and 'and' symbols
- Learners can use bash `for` statements
- [Learners have practiced using a book on bash/Linux](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_intermediate_bash_linux/issues/7)

As sources of text, I consider to use:

- `man bash`
- `[Shotts, 2024]`
  and can be found in this repository at `books/the_linux_command_line.pdf`
- `[Iliev, 2020]`


Missing: `dos2unix` and `unix2dos`

- [ ] Suggest to add it to curriculum
