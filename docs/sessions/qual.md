# Quality of Life

This chapter is a little different to the others. It is not about a tool or an operator, but about some things that can help you make it nicer to use Linux/Bash on the command line. 

## What's in here 

- We will talk about background processes, learning how to start them with ``&`` and terminate them 
- We will look at some useful terminal shortcuts and their usage

- We will learn about using aliases 
- Also a few other small odds and ends
