# Archiving

This section will cover compressing/decompressing files and directories. We will focus on (g)zip and tar.

!!! note "Objectives"

    **Questions**

    - How do I compress and decompress files and directories under Linux?
    - How do I create an archive (tarball)?

    **Learning objectives**

    - Learn about compressing and decompressing files and directories with gzip
    - Learn about archiving (creating a tarball) with tar

## Compressing and decompressing - (g)zip

Compressing files on Linux are generally done with utilities like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/gzip.html" target="_blank">gzip</a>, <a href="http://www.bzip.org/" target="_blank">bzip2</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">zip</a>.

### gzip

Compression utility designed as a replacement for compress, with much better compression and no patented algorithms. The standard compression system for all GNU software.

!!! note

    ``gzip`` is the **recommended** compression system!

**Common options**:

- **-d**: Decompress the file(s) instead of compressing them. Shortcut is ``gunzip``
- **-r**: Recursively compress/decompress directories and their contents.
- **-k**: Keep the original file(s) after compression.
- **-v**: Display verbose output, showing the compression ratio and other details.

#### Examples

!!! tip

    Code along!

    Use the files and folders in the directory "exercises" -> "arch"

!!! note "Compress a file (also removes the uncompressed file)"

    ```bash
    gzip afile.txt
    ```

    How it looks for me:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 229 May 28 13:22 afile.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ gzip afile.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 180 May 28 13:22 afile.txt.gz
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt
    ls: cannot access 'afile.txt': No such file or directory
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$
    ```

    The file "afile.txt" was compressed and the uncompressed file is removed.

!!! note "Uncompress a file (also removes the compressed file)"

    ```bash
    gunzip afile.txt.gz
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    gzip -d afile.txt.gz
    ```

    For me it looks like this (using gunzip):
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 180 May 28 13:22 afile.txt.gz
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ gunzip afile.txt.gz
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 229 May 28 13:22 afile.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt.gz
    ls: cannot access 'afile.txt.gz': No such file or directory
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$
    ```

!!! note "Compress a file (and keep the uncompressed file)"

    ```bash
    gzip -k afile.txt
    ```

    How it looks for me:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 229 May 28 13:22 afile.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ gzip -k afile.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 229 May 28 13:22 afile.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls -la afile.txt.gz
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 180 May 28 13:22 afile.txt.gz
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$
    ```

!!! note "Compress all files in a directory"

    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls dir2
    dir4  myfile-new.txt  testfile3.txt  testfile4.txt
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ gzip -r dir2
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls dir2
    dir4  myfile-new.txt.gz  testfile3.txt.gz  testfile4.txt.gz
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls dir2/dir4/
    bfile.txt.gz  cfile.txt.gz
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$
    ```

    ``gunzip -r dir2`` would then un-gzip all the files again.

!!! warning

    ``gzip`` does not archive the files into one file, just compress them!

    For archiving files, ``tar`` is your friend - often in combination with ``gzip``. More about that soon!

### bzip (optional)

**bzip** offers strong, lossless data compressor based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. Also available as a library.

May compress better than gzip, but is slower.

#### Examples

We are not going to cover ``bzip`` more than to briefly give the most common usage.

!!! note "Compress a file (also removes the uncompressed file)"

    ```bash
    bzip2 afile.txt
    ```

!!! note "Uncompress a file (also removes the compressed file)"

    ```bash
    bunzip2 afile.txt.bz2
    ```

### zip (optional)

**zip** is a simple compression and file packaging utility.

!!! Note

    The maximum size limit of a zip file is 4GB and if this size limit is exceeded, the file becomes prone to corruption. This further leads to failure of the extraction process and inaccessibility of your data.

#### Examples

!!! hint

    Code along!

    Again, use the files in "exercises" -> "arch"

!!! note "Compressing afile.txt"

    ```bash
    zip afile.zip afile.txt
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ zip afile.zip afile.txt
      adding: afile.txt (deflated 34%)
    ```

!!! note "Uncompressing afile.zip"

    If the file already exists, zip will ask if you want to replace or rename

    ```bash
    unzip afile.zip
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ unzip afile.zip
    Archive:  afile.zip
    replace afile.txt? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: r
    new name: afile-copy.txt
      inflating: afile-copy.txt
    ```

!!! note "Compress all files in one directory to a single archive file"

    ```bash
    zip -r dir1.zip dir1/
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ zip -r dir1.zip dir1
      adding: dir1/ (stored 0%)
      adding: dir1/testfile (stored 0%)
      adding: dir1/testfile.txt (stored 0%)
      adding: dir1/testfile2.txt (deflated 2%)
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ ls dir1.zip
    dir1.zip
    ```

!!! note "Compress all files of a certain type in the current directory (and in directories under this) to a single archive file"

    In this example case for all .c files

    ```bash
    zip -r my_c_files.zip . -i \*.c
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ zip -r my_c_files.zip . -i \*.c
      adding: morefile.c (stored 0%)
      adding: C/Adding2.c (deflated 31%)
      adding: C/Greeting.c (stored 0%)
      adding: C/hello.c (stored 0%)
      adding: C/mpi_greeting.c (deflated 35%)
      adding: C/mpi_hello.c (deflated 35%)
      adding: C/mpi_hi.c (deflated 36%)
      adding: C/Mult2.c (deflated 33%)
      adding: C/omp_hello.c (deflated 58%)
    ```

## Archiving - tar

Archiving is generally done with ``tar``.

This program saves many files together into a single archive file (concatenates them), and it also restores individual files from the archive. Automatic archive compression/decompression options exists (with various different compression utilities), as well as special features that allow ``tar`` to be used for incremental and full backups.

The command ``tar --help`` will give the format (defaults to gnu). This is generally only important for files larger than 8 GB.

``tar`` was originally developed for magnetic tape storage â€“ reading and writing data for a sequential I/O device with no file system, and the name is short for the format description "tape archive".

!!! note

    A **tarball** is a commonly used name to refer to an archive file in the ``tar`` (Tape Archive) format.

    A tarball can be compressed with something like ``gzip`` or ``bzip2``. There are options/flags to do this automatically with ``tar``.

### Syntax

```bash
tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]
```

### Basic options

- **-c, --create** - create a new archive
- **-a, --auto-compress** - additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with *.tar.gz then use gzip, if*.tar.xz then use xz, *.tar.zst for Zstandard etc.
- **-r, --append** - append files to the end of an archive
- **-x, --extract, --get** - extract files from an archive
- **-f, --file** - specify the archive's name
- **-t, --list** - show a list of files and folders in the archive
- **-v, --verbose** - show a list of processed files

### Examples

!!! hint

    Code along!

    Again use the files and folders under "exercises" -> "arch"

!!! note "Generate a tarball"

    ```bash
    tar -cvf arch.tar arch/
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises/arch$ cd ..

    ```

!!! note "Extracting the files from a tarball"

    ```bash
    tar -xvf arch.tar
    ```

    Warning! If there is already a directory with the same name in the directory you do this, it will overwrite without asking!

!!! note "Generate a tarball and compress it with gzip"

    ```bash

    bbrydsoe@enterprise:~/exercises$ ls -al arch.tar
    -rw-r--r-- 1 bbrydsoe folk 40960 May 28 14:27 arch.tar
    ```

!!! note "Uncompressing and extracting files from a tarball"

    ```bash
    tar -zxvf arch.tar.gz
    ```

    Warning! If there is already a directory with the same name in the directory you do this, it will overwrite without asking!

## Summary
