# Evaluations

???- question "Where can I evaluate this course?"

    Go to [evaluation](../evaluation.md) (singular) :-)

Here are the evaluation results of this course:

No |Dates                    |Evaluations                     |Success score
---|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------
1  |2025-06-02 and 2025-06-03|[Evaluation](20250602/README.md)|77%
2  |2025-12-04 and 2025-12-05|[Evaluation](20251204/README.md)|.

- The 'Success score' is the average confidence the learners
  have on each of the learning outcomes of the course
