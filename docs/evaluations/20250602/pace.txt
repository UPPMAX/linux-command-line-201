good, perhaps slightly quick
It is balanced.
I was good
I think is good but I did not code along as I saw that then I catch less information
today intensive and less time to do exercise
Good! just tight for the exercises
The pace was good, quite high but for this type of intermediate course I think that is not a problem. I can go back to the things I found the most interesting or difficult later.
A little quick, some extra time would help particularly for Birgittes section
The pace was excellent
Ok on Monday, a bit rushed towards the end on Tuesday
Maybe it was a bit quick? I mean, it was easy to follow and understand, but then there was very little time to actually practice the exercises properly. I think it's normal given that the course was short!
