## Welcome ad (Living document)

In this 6-hour 2-day workshop you'll learn how to work smarter from a command line. You can follow either day or both. To do so, you'll learn more Bash commands, scripting and some quality of life topics. You can run on your own (Linux) computer or on your favorite HPC cluster.

At the end of each day, you should feel to be able to work smarter and able to avoid more grunt work (i.e. anything that involves repeated copypaste).

The workshop is intended for users with some Linux experience, see [the prerequisites](https://uppmax.github.io/linux-command-line-201/prerequisites/).

Time: 2 and 3 June, each day from 9-12
