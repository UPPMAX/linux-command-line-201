## Welcome ad (Living document)

In this Y-hour/X-day workshop you'll learn how to work smarter from a command line. To do so, you'll learn more Bash commands, scripting and some quality of life topics. You can run on your own (Linux) computer or on your favorite HPC cluster.

At the end of the day, you should feel to be able to work smarter and able to avoid more grunt work (i.e. anything that involves repeated copy-paste).

The workshop is intended for users with some Linux experience, see [the prerequisites](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intermediate_bash_linux/prerequisites/). You do not need to be a member of a NAISS project in order to join the workshop, as we will provide one for you.

Time: 2-3 June at 9-12
