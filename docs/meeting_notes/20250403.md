## Welcome ad (Living document, start)

In this Y-hour/X-day workshop you learn to use a LINUX-style command line and BASH commands and scripting.
You can run on your own computer but your learnings will be beneficial also if you are working on an HPC cluster.

At the end of the day, you should be comfortable in working on the commandline and do simple bash scripting, giving quality to your terminal life.

The workshop is intended for beginner users but with some Linux experience, see prerequisites on course page. You do not need to be a member of a NAISS project in order to join the workshop.
