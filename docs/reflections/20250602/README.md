- Q: The `sort` command doesn’t behave quite the same for me as in the example,
  could this be because I’m using a Mac? (see answer below 😊 )
    - A: [Richel] Yes: different unix-like systems have slightly different
      tools, with slightly different behavior. We’ll all have to live with
      that 😊. In the end, running ‘man sort’ to find how your `sort` works
      exactly is the only way to go.
- Q: What is the difference between “| tee” and > ? I’ve been using > and it
  seems to do the same thing
    - A: [Richel] Well spotted! Besides echoing, `tee`also produces a file as
      a by-product. `tee` is named after a T junction (imagine a river!),
      where 'water’ (in this case: text) is going via two ways
      now. `[Thanks!][Richel: You are welcome :-)]`
- Q: Is there any advantage to using egrep instead of grep –E etc.?
  Why have both/teach us both?  
    - A: [Birgitte] they are equivalent, it is just personal preference.
      Some people would find it easier to remember/use egrep than grep –E  
    - A: [Richel] if you start using tools that check for style,
      you will find out that `egrep` will be warned against.  
- Q: Why do some of the options have more versions? Like, long recursive and
  short r? Also some are really not very easily named,
  like - - text is –a
    - A: [Birgitte] I guess again personal preference.
      The long version is usually a better mnemonic in the way it is named,
      while the short version may (as you say) not be,
      but it is quicker to write.  
- Q: Can you recommend a short online intro to awk (not a whole book)
  just like a couple pages with the most important?
    - A [Richel]: I think this book is closest to that:
      it is not an AWK book at all. I have seen only one course that uses
      the one-liner approach (which happens to be mine 😊)
      at <https://uppmax.github.io/awk_course/> .
      Does that answer your question?
        - Thanks. I will read it! I meant something like what for the other
          section with pipe and wc/Cut.  
            - [Richel] I don’t make those cheat sheets on **purpose**:
              it takes away your learning. You are encouraged to make one:
              it is great for learning 😊
                - Not sure that works for me. I’ll check your other course,
                  and do some googling. Thanks!
                    - [Richel] Great! Asking AIs is all the hype nowadays
                      too ...
                        - Tried it. Got like 8 wrong of 10 so wasn’t cool 🙁  
                            - [Richel] Too bad it does not work!
                              The book used, however, only shows 4 lines of
                              AWK of which 3 are used.
                              Maybe that is little enough...
                            - There is a cheat sheet here:
                              <https://quickref.me/awk.html>  
                                - [Richel] Well done!
                                - Thnx for finding this! I also get intimidated
                                  having to look in a book for a short course
                                  like this, so prefer a short text like that.
                                  Would have prefered one styled to the course
                                  so I know what we are expected to know
